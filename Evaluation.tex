\section{Baseline}
In this section, we describe the baseline we use to evaluate the efficiency of fuzzers generated by RLC.
As a baseline, we need a simpler method of automatically generating fuzzers for game descriptions. Any such method
needs to establish an abstraction for how a game is described. We have chosen to use the abstraction of OpenSpiel, 
Google DeepMind's framework for applying reinforcement learning methods to games (TODO: I probably need to describe
 OpenSpiel in greater detail.).
